    This button, will send the Appliance.Control.Unbind PUSH
    through the broker thus completely resetting the binding of
    the device and removing it from the Meross account (if Meross paired)
    pretty destructive...

    BTW:
    I think having a simple UI button which could just be pressed and BOOM!
    is a very bad idea from a UX perspective. Any trick (like raising an
    error on first attempt or so) could just prove to be useless since people
    don't read pop-ups. I'll move this feature to a redesign of the OptionsFlow
    (lot of work to be done...sadly..) by introducing a menu and letting the
    user consciously step by step proceed to destruction.

    This code is left for reference...buttons might prove to be useful in
    other contexts

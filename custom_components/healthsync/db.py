"""A private, append-only archive of every sample HealthSync has ever
received, independent of Home Assistant's own recorder.

Why this exists: HA's regular entity state history is always timestamped at
the moment it was written (there is no supported way to backdate a state
change), and HA's long-term statistics API only stores hourly aggregates
(min/max/mean) — never individual readings. Neither can hold "every reading,
at its own exact Apple-recorded timestamp, completely unaveraged" — which is
the whole point here. This sidesteps both limits by not living in HA's
recorder at all: a small SQLite database of its own, storing every field of
every sample exactly as the app sent it (plus a raw_payload JSON copy, so
nothing is ever lost even if a future metric adds fields this schema
doesn't have a dedicated column for yet). Queryable on demand via the
healthsync.get_readings service — see __init__.py.

Stored under Home Assistant's own .storage directory so it's picked up
automatically by HA's Backup/Snapshot system, the same as everything else
HA considers "its" data.

    Home Assistant's long-term statistics, dated to the hour Apple actually
    recorded it in — added 12 Aug 2026 because the sensor's plain state only
    ever reflects "whatever was last received", collapsing everything that
    happened between syncs down to a single point timestamped at sync time.

    HA's statistics API only supports hourly-resolution backdated points —
    there is no supported way to backdate raw state history at all, and
    long-term statistics themselves are hard-capped at the hour (confirmed
    against a real developer's account of hitting this exact wall on HA's
    own community forum). So this buckets every reading within the hour it
    actually happened in and re-imports that hour's min/max/mean on every
    new arrival. `async_import_statistics` upserts by (statistic_id, hour),
    so calling it repeatedly for the same hour is safe and only ever makes
    that hour more accurate as more of its readings arrive — it never
    duplicates or corrupts anything.

    Buckets are kept in memory only (not persisted across HA restarts) and
    pruned once they're more than 48h old — a hobby-scale app like this
    doesn't need anything fancier than a simple bound on unlimited growth
    over long uptimes; a restart mid-hour just means that one hour stops
    getting further refined, which is a minor, self-correcting edge case,
    not a real loss (whatever was already imported stays in HA's history).

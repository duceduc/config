"""The Solstice Season integration.

This integration provides precise, daily seasonal information as sensors
in Home Assistant. It calculates astronomical events and provides various
calendar-based sensors.

v2.0 Architecture:
- Each config entry creates one device with its own coordinator
- Device types: Base Data, Four Seasons, Cross-Quarter, Chinese Solar Terms
- No shared state between devices
- Hemisphere is fixed after configuration (no runtime changes)
